    <p><strong>Lemon Cake</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lemon zest</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place blueberries, 3 tablespoons white sugar, and 1 tablespoon lemon juice into a 
        saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until blueberries begin to release 
        their juices. Mash blueberries with a potato masher until broken up. Bring mixture to 
        a simmer, and reduce heat to low.</li>
      <li>Mix together cornstarch and water in a small bowl until combined. Add to blueberry 
        mixture, stirring constantly. Cook until mixture has thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour 
        blueberry filling into a shallow bowl; place in the refrigerator to cool while you 
        prepare the rest of the cake.</li>
      <li>For the <em>crumb topping</em>, combine 1/2 cup flour, brown sugar, 1/8 teaspoon 
        salt, and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times to 
        combine. Add in 1/4 cup cold butter, and pulse several more times until mixture 
        resembles coarse sand. Pour mixture into a small bowl. Using your hands, press mixture 
        together until it forms medium to large-sized crumbs. Place crumbs into the refrigerator 
        while you prepare the cake.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with 
        enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
      <li>To the bowl of the food processor (no need to clean it after preparing the crumb 
        topping), add 1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 1/2 
        teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg. Pulse a few times to combine. Add in 1/2 
        cup cold butter, and pulse several more times until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, mix together buttermilk, egg, lemon zest, 
        lemon juice, and vanilla until combined. Add this mixture to the food processor, and 
        pulse until mixture just comes together, and no dry bits of flour remain, stopping to 
        scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Batter will look somewhat lumpy from 
        the cold butter, but this is normal.</li>
      <li>Pour about 2/3 of the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth into an even layer. 
        emove blueberry filling from the refrigerator and spread evenly over the batter in the 
        pan. Place dollops of remaining batter over the blueberry filling, and spread until 
        most of the filling is covered with a thin layer of batter. (It is ok if not all the 
        blueberry filling is covered with batter.) Remove crumb topping from the refrigerator 
        and sprinkle evenly over the top of the batter. Very lightly press crumbs down to 
        slightly adhere to the batter.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the middle of the cake 
        springs back lightly when touched. Cool cake in the pan until nearly room temperature, 
        about 10 minutes. Remove cake, using the parchment overhang, to a wire rack to cool 
        completely, about 20 minutes. Cut into 12 pieces.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>You can also make this without a food processor. Simply mix dry ingredients together, 
      then cut in butter by hand, and then proceed with the recipe as written. You can also 
      use fresh blueberries instead of frozen.</p>
