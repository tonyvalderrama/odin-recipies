    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In these chewy brown butter caramel chai cookies, youâ€™ll find brown butter 
      and chai spices are a perfect pair. The dough does need to chill in the fridge 
      for about 30 minutes before baking, so be sure to plan ahead.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>Chai Spice Mix</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cookie Dough</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup caramel sauce</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chai spice mix</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cookie Dough</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chai spice mix</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Stir cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves together in a small 
        bowl; set aside.</li>
      <li>Place butter into a light-colored, medium-sized saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, 
        stirring often, until butter begins to brown and smells nutty, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour 
        butter into a large mixing bowl, and let cool for about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>To the bowl with the browned butter, add brown sugar, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 
        1/4 cup caramel sauce, egg, and vanilla; mix until combined. If caramel sauce is very 
        thick, chunks of caramel may remain; clumps of caramel smaller than 1/2-inch are okay. 
        Mix in flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the chai spice mix, baking powder, baking soda, and 
        salt until combined. Chill dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with silicone 
        baking mats or parchment paper.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, stir together 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 tablespoon of chai spice mix.</li>
      <li>Remove dough from the fridge, and scoop out a 1 tablespoon-sized piece of dough and 
        roll into a ball. Roll dough ball in the chai-sugar mixture until coated. Place on the 
        prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and place dough balls 2 inches apart 
        onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
      <li>Bake cookies in the preheated oven until they begin to crack on top and look slightly 
        set, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on the pan for a few minutes before removing 
        to a wire rack to cool completely. If desired, drizzle cooled cookies with extra caramel sauce.</li>
    </ol>
